# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction

Requirement Analysis is a crucial phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) that focuses on gathering, analyzing, documenting, and validating the needs and expectations of stakeholders. This repository aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the requirement analysis process, including techniques, tools, and best practices.

The purpose of this repository is to serve as a learning resource and a practical guide for creating clear and detailed requirement documents, use case diagrams, and acceptance criteria. By following the structured approach documented here, developers and project managers can ensure better project planning, avoid scope creep, and deliver software that meets user needs.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the process of gathering, understanding, and defining the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system. It is a critical phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) because it lays the foundation for all subsequent development activities.

During Requirement Analysis, developers, business analysts, and stakeholders collaborate to identify both functional requirements (what the system should do) and non-functional requirements (how the system should perform). This process involves techniques such as interviews, surveys, brainstorming sessions, and prototyping to ensure all needs are clearly captured and understood.

The importance of Requirement Analysis lies in its ability to:

- Prevent misunderstandings and reduce costly changes later in the development process.
- Define clear project scope and objectives.
- Provide a detailed blueprint for designing, developing, and testing the software.
- Ensure that the final product aligns with business goals and user expectations.
## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis is a vital step in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) because it ensures that the project is built on a solid foundation. Here are three key reasons why it is critical:

1. **Clarifies Project Scope**  
   It helps define what the system should and should not do, preventing scope creep and keeping the project focused on its goals.

2. **Improves Communication**  
   By involving stakeholders early and documenting their needs clearly, it ensures everyone — developers, clients, and users — shares the same understanding.

3. **Reduces Risks and Costs**  
   Identifying issues, missing features, or misunderstandings early in the process reduces costly changes and rework during development and testing phases.
## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

- **Requirement Gathering:** Collecting initial requirements from stakeholders through interviews, surveys, and observation to understand their needs and expectations.

- **Requirement Elicitation:** Refining and clarifying gathered information by using techniques like brainstorming, workshops, and prototyping to uncover hidden or unstated requirements.

- **Requirement Documentation:** Creating detailed and structured documents such as requirement specifications, use cases, and user stories to clearly communicate the requirements.

- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling:** Analyzing requirements to identify conflicts, overlaps, and dependencies, and representing them visually using models and diagrams (e.g., use case diagrams, data flow diagrams).

- **Requirement Validation:** Reviewing and confirming requirements with stakeholders to ensure accuracy, completeness, and feasibility before development begins.
## Types of Requirements

### Functional Requirements

Functional requirements describe the specific behaviors, functions, or features that the system must have. They define what the system should do to satisfy user needs.

**Examples for the Booking Management System:**  
- Users can search for available properties by location and date.  
- The system allows users to create and manage bookings.  
- Users must be able to register and log in securely.  
- The system sends booking confirmation emails to users.  

### Non-functional Requirements

Non-functional requirements describe how the system performs its functions. They specify criteria related to system quality, such as performance, security, usability, and reliability.

**Examples for the Booking Management System:**  
- The system must load search results within 2 seconds.  
- User data must be encrypted to ensure privacy and security.  
- The system should be available 99.9% of the time (high availability).  
- The user interface should be intuitive and accessible on mobile devices.
## Use Case Diagrams

Use Case Diagrams are visual representations used in Requirement Analysis to show the interactions between users (called actors) and the system. They help illustrate what the system does from the user’s perspective, making it easier to understand requirements and design the system.

**Benefits of Use Case Diagrams:**  
- Clarify system functionality and user roles  
- Facilitate communication between stakeholders and developers  
- Help identify system boundaries and interactions  
- Support writing detailed use case descriptions  

### Example: Booking Management System Use Case Diagram

The main actors in the booking system include:  
- **Customer**: Searches properties, makes bookings, cancels bookings.  
- **Admin**: Manages listings, oversees bookings, handles user issues.  
- **Payment Gateway**: Processes payments securely.  

The primary use cases are:  
- Search Properties  
- Make Booking  
- Cancel Booking  
- Manage Listings  
- Process Payment  

Below is a diagram illustrating these actors and use cases:
